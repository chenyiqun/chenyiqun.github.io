## About me

My name is Yiqun Chen (陈逸群, in Chinese). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, under the guidance of Professor [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/). Before this, I earned my Master’s degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and my Bachelor’s degree from Shandong University. 

My research interests lie in Information Retrieval, including the Search Result Diversification (SRD), the application of Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval and Large Language Model for Ranking. Furthermore, I am also have the experience of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).

If you are interested in my research or experience, please feel free to contact me.
