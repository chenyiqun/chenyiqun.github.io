## About me

My name is Yiqun Chen (陈逸群, in Chinese). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, under the guidance of Professor [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/). Before this, I earned my Master’s degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and my Bachelor’s degree from Shandong University. 

My research interests lie in:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Large Language Models (LLM) for Ranking**
- **Information Retrieval**
  - Search Result Diversification (SRD)
  - Application of Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**

If you are interested in my research or experience, please feel free to contact me.
